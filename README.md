# Laura-Neff-Giftastic-io
A project that experiments with using the Giphy API
Made with AJAX calls, on click events from JQuery, and for loops.

Dessert Oasis generates gifs based on any dessert you input from the Giphy API. If you click on the gifs, they will freeze in place, and if you click on it again, they will start moving again. The website will not show its functionality due to the fact that API keys are so vulnerable to display on GitHub, but if you look at my code, you will see how I implemented this.
